### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

East is [configured](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/automated-builds#jekyll) to work with [Aerobatic](http://aerobatic.com/).

---

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `_posts` directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

The following is a post file with different configurations you can add as example:

{% highlight shell %}
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to Jekyll!
featured: true
author: ahmad
tags: [python, ruby, java, ruby-on-rails]
image: '/images/posts/image.jpeg'
---
{% endhighlight %}

You can set the author, featured or not, tags, and the post image.

The `featured` key is to mark the post as a featured post, this will add a simple star icon (☆) to the post card.

![featured-post](/images/docs/jekyll/east/featured-post.png)

To keep things more organized, add post images to **/images/pages** directory, and add page images to **/images/pages** directory.

To create a draft post, create the post file under the **_drafts** directory, and you can find more information at [Working with Drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).

---

### Pages

To create a new page, just create a new markdown file inside the `_pages` directory.

The following is the `about.md` file that you can find as an example included in the theme with the configurations you can set.

{% highlight shell %}
---
layout: page
title: About
image: '/images/pages/about.jpeg'
---
{% endhighlight %}

Things you can change are: `title` and `image` path.

---

### Navigation

The navigation on the sidebar will automatically include all the links to the pages you have created.

---

### Disqus Comments

East Theme comes with Disqus comments enabled.

Open `_includes/disqus.html` file, and change the `aspirethemes` value on line 15 with your [Disqus account shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

{% highlight js %}
s.src = '//aspirethemes-demo.disqus.com/embed.js';
{% endhighlight %}

So, if your Disqus shortname is `exampleone`, the final code above should be

{% highlight js %}
s.src = '//exampleone.disqus.com/embed.js';
{% endhighlight %}

That's all you need to setup Disqus from the theme side. If you get any issue regarding that comments are unable to load. First, make sure you have [registered your website with Disqus (Step 1)](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466182-publisher-quick-start-guide)

And also check [Disqus troubleshooting guide](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22) if you still have issues.

### MailChimp

Steps to integrate [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) newsletter subscription form:

* Create a mailing list from your MailChimp account, fill all the fields required and save it.
* From the list page, select **Signup forms**, then select **Embedded forms**.
* You may want to change or edit the form fields, or customize the form in general, after you have done and everything is OK, you will be provided by HTML code, what we need to integrate with East theme is the code in the action element, like the highlighted code in the image blow.
* Copy that code and paste it in the form HTML element in `_includes/subscribe-form.html` where you can find the newsletter form.
* You are done.
